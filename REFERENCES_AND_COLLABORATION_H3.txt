Homework Assignment 3
References and Collaboration Statement

Collaboration:
I did not collaborate with anyone while working on this assignment.

Sources:
Used ChatGPT for the part below specifically, I was somewhat familiar with switch statements but this section was unusually difficult for me. 
By using ChatGPT, I found that my issue was incorrect formatting on the starting tags (.html, .js) which led to a multitude of errors.

let ext = path.extname(filePath);
        let contentType = 'text/html';
        switch (ext) {
            case '.html': contentType = 'text/html'; break;
            case '.js': contentType = 'application/javascript'; break;
            case '.css': contentType = 'text/css'; break;
            case '.json': contentType = 'application/json'; break;
            case '.png': contentType = 'image/png'; break;
            case '.jpg':
            case '.jpeg': contentType = 'image/jpeg'; break;
            case '.gif': contentType = 'image/gif'; break;
        }

        res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': contentType });
        res.end(data);
    });
}
